# Cheat Sheet for Mathematical Concepts

## 1. Complete and Regular Graph

### **Complete Graph**
A complete graph is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. If the graph has \( n \) vertices, it has \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) edges. A complete graph is denoted by \( K_n \).

**Example**:
For a complete graph with 4 vertices \( K_4 \), the graph contains 6 edges.

### **Regular Graph**
A regular graph is a graph where every vertex has the same degree, i.e., the same number of edges. A graph is \( k \)-regular if every vertex has degree \( k \).

## 2. Pigeonhole Principle

The **Pigeonhole Principle** states that if \( n \) items are placed into \( m \) containers, and \( n > m \), then at least one container must contain more than one item.

**Example**:
Suppose there are 11 pigeons and 10 pigeonholes. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.

---

## 3. Partial Order Relation

For a set \( S \), the relation \( a \leq b \) (a is less than or equal to b) is a **partial order** because:
- **Reflexive**: \( a \leq a \) for all \( a \in S \).
- **Antisymmetric**: If \( a \leq b \) and \( b \leq a \), then \( a = b \).
- **Transitive**: If \( a \leq b \) and \( b \leq c \), then \( a \leq c \).

Thus, \( \leq \) is a partial order on the set of all numbers.

## 4. Hasse Diagram for \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24\} \)

### **Set**:
\( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24\} \)

### **Relation**:
"Divides" (i.e., \( a \) divides \( b \)).

### **Hasse Diagram**:
 24
 /   |   \
12 8 18 / \ / \ /
6 4 6 9 12 18 | | | 3 2 1

- The Hasse diagram is a graphical representation of the divisibility relation.

## 5. Composition of Functions

### i. \( (f \circ g \circ h)(x) \):
Given:
- \( f(x) = 3x^2 + 2 \)
- \( g(x) = 7x - 5 \)
- \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x} \)

The composition \( (f \circ g \circ h)(x) \) is:
\[
(f \circ g \circ h)(x) = f(g(h(x))) = f\left(g\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) = f\left(7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - 5\right) = f\left(\frac{7}{x} - 5\right)
\]
\[
= 3\left(\frac{7}{x} - 5\right)^2 + 2
\]

### ii. \( (g \circ g)(x) \):
\[
(g \circ g)(x) = g(g(x)) = g(7x - 5) = 7(7x - 5) - 5 = 49x - 35 - 5 = 49x - 40
\]

### iii. \( (g \circ h)(x) \):
\[
(g \circ h)(x) = g(h(x)) = g\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = 7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - 5 = \frac{7}{x} - 5
\]

## 6. Cyclic Group is Abelian

- A **cyclic group** is a group generated by a single element. Every element of the group can be written as powers of the generator.
- **Abelian**: A cyclic group is abelian because the group operation (multiplication) is commutative. The elements are powers of the generator, and powers of the generator commute with each other.

---

## 7. Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)

- **DNF**: \( xy' + x'y' + x'y \)
- **CNF**: \( (x + y)(x' + y)(x' + y') \)

---

## 8. Injectivity of \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \)

- The function \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \) is **not injective** because \( f(1) = f(-1) = 0 \), but \( 1 \neq -1 \).

---

## 9. Boolean Algebra Proofs

### i. \( [x' (x + y)]' + [ y (y+x')]' + [ y (y'+x)] [y (y’ + x)]’ = 1 \)
- Simplify using Boolean identities.

### ii. \( (x + yz)(y' + x)(y' + z') = x(y' + z') \)
- Apply Boolean simplifications.

---

## 10. Binomial Theorem Identity

- **Identity**: \( \binom{n+1}{r} = \binom{n}{r-1} + \binom{n}{r} \)
- Proven using Pascal’s Rule.

| T      | T      | T                    | T               | F           | T                          | T                     | T                |
| T      | F      | F                    | F               | F           | F                          | T                     | F                |
| F      | T      | T                    | F               | T           | T                          | F                     | T                |
| F      | F      | T                    | F               | T           | F                          | T                     | F                |

- **Abelian Group Check**:
  - **Closure**: \( (x * y) \in \mathbb{Z} \).
  - **Associative**: Verified by direct computation.
  - **Identity**: The identity is \( e = -1 \).
  - **Inverse**: \( x^{-1} = -x - 1 \).

---

## 13. Inverse of Equivalence Relation

If \( R \) is an equivalence relation, then \( R^{-1} \) is also an equivalence relation because it satisfies:
- **Reflexivity**: \( aRa \) implies \( a^{-1}Ra^{-1} \).
- **Symmetry**: If \( aRb \), then \( bRa \).
- **Transitivity**: If \( aRb \) and \( bRc \), then \( aRc \).

---

## 14. Divisibility Relation

The divisibility relation \( a \mid b \) on \( \mathbb{N} \) is a **partial order** because it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.

---

## 15. Algebraic Structure \( G = \{1, -1, i, -i\} \)

### i. **Abelian**:
- \( G \) is abelian because multiplication of complex numbers is commutative.

### ii. **Order of Elements**:
- \( 1, -1, i, -i \) all have order 4.

### iii. **Cyclic Group**:
- \( G \) is cyclic, generated by \( i \). The generator is \( i \), and \( i^4 = 1 \).

---

## 16. Adjacency Matrix

The **adjacency matrix** represents a graph where entry \( a_{ij} = 1 \) if there's an edge between vertices \( i \) and \( j \), else 0.

---

## 17. Subgroup Condition

A necessary and sufficient condition for a non-empty subset \( H \) of a group \( G \) to be a subgroup is that for any \( a, b \in H \), the element \( ab^{-1} \) must also be in \( H \).

---

## 18. Lagrange's Theorem

Lagrange’s Theorem states that the **order of a subgroup** \( H \) divides the **order of the group** \( G \).

---

## 19. Distributive Laws in Lattices

### i. \( a \land (b \lor c) \geq (a \land b) \lor (a \land c) \)

### ii. \( a \lor (b \land c) \leq (a \lor b) \land (a \lor c) \)

---

## 20. Bijective Function \( f(x) = \frac{x - 1}{x - 3} \)

- **Injective**: Proved by showing that if \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \), then \( x_1 = x_2 \).
- **Surjective**: The function is surjective as every real number \( y \) has a corresponding \( x \).
- **Inverse**: \( f^{-1}(y) = \frac{3y + 1}{y - 1} \).
