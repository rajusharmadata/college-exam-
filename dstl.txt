6. Cyclic Group is Abelian
A cyclic group is a group generated by a single element. Every element of the group can be written as powers of the generator.
Abelian: A cyclic group is abelian because the group operation (multiplication) is commutative. The elements are powers of the generator, and powers of the generator commute with each other.
